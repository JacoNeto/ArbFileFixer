    "HOW_GROUP_ASSIGNMENT_WORKS_TITLE": "Who decides which group I will be in?",
    "HOW_IT_WORKS_1ST_PART": "The division is simple. If your group has 7 people in it, you will barely have a division. If you have between 8 and 14 participants, half of the people that are in your group will be in the 1st Division, League A (Professionals), and the other half will be in the 2nd Division, League B (Semi-professionals). The participants can ascend to the 1st division or descend to the 2nd division at the end of each game during the competition. The people with the most points will remain in the professional division and those with the  least points in the Semi-Pro. You can ascend or descend freely between the divisions. What determines your position are the points you win. ",
    "HOW_IT_WORKS_2ND_PART": "If your group has more participants, the divisions continue to increase up to a maximum of five divisions. The amateurs are assigned to the 3rd division (15 to 23 participants), the 4th division is comprised of the juniors (24 to 49 players), and in the 5th are the lanterns (over 50 players).",

    "HOW_IT_WORKS_TITLE": "How the divisions work",
    "MORE_FUN_WITH_DIVISIONS_DESCRIPTION_1ST_PART": "It's important that you know what normally occurs in a tradicional Pick the Winner game. Almost always, a few people win more points (the professionals-the lucky ones in the group) and they distance themselves from the rest of the crowd. The typical result of the traditional pick the winner games is this: those that are at the bottom lose interest in playing and they stop engaging. With our \"Magnificent\" point system and the \"Fantastic\" divisions, nobody falls behind, everyone competes within their category. It’s a good deal for everyone. And I'll tell you more: the competition is fiercest (and the most fun) in the semi-professional and amateur categories. If this doesn't happen, you can talk to me at the end.",
    "MORE_FUN_WITH_DIVISIONS_DESCRIPTION_2ND_PART": "It’s easy to predict the outcome here: at the end of the tournament, some players will purposely make bad choices in order to descend to the second division, because they are far from the top of the top ranking, and closer to winning the second division. This makes it even more fun, because there will be many players in the first division that have no chance of reaching the top at League A, and many players in the second division are close to winning League B. If anyone decides to lose just to descend, they could descend too far. The competition will become even more complicated. And you can imagine what that means, outrageous fun.",
    "MORE_FUN_WITH_DIVISIONS_TITLE": "Maximize fun with the divisions",
    "SUMMARY": "You may have noticed that the ranking is separated by divisions. So, pay close attention. These divisions are the biggest innovation in the Pick a Winner system, since its invention by a mysterious English Baron in 1903. But, before we explain why we decided to revolutionize the Brazilian contests and those worldwide, you need to understand the following:",
    "TALKING_TO_YOU_DESCRIPTION_1ST_PART": "Halfway through the tournament, your group will have so much fun that you will hug your friend that invited you to play this App.",
    "TALKING_TO_YOU_DESCRIPTION_2ND_PART": "This system, pal, is going to change how these contests among friends are played in Brazil and the world. History books about these games will all need to be updated. You, in this exact moment, are living the second tournament since this mechanism was put into action (remember in 2018, when this App went viral, and we were headline on the front page of the biggest Brazilian newspaper? And in 2022 we passed 350 thousand users and thousands of compliments). Now the system for the women's cup in 2023.",
    "TALKING_TO_YOU_DESCRIPTION_3RD_PART": "Ah! If the mysterious Baron that invented this game, back in 1903, were alive today, he would definitely be proud. \"What took so long to invent this?\", he would ask. Not a second more, Baron! A new chapter is starting now.",
    "TALKING_TO_YOU_TITLE": "I’m telling you. It’s awesome!",
    "DIVISIONS_TITLE": "The beauty of the divisions",
    "WHY_1ST_PART": "Imagine the group you created to pick the winner. You have that uncle that knows nothing about soccer, and everytime he watches a game with you he asks \"What’s the offside rule again?\" Just like him, you have your grandmother that you decided to invite to the family team. In the same group, there`s also your sister and you, two experts who know everything about the game. There you are the four of you in the same group. Do you think that your uncle is going to stay interested in competing with you? When you start, after some lucky picks here and there, he’s going to think he’s the king. But halfway through the tournament, your uncle and your grandmother are going to be far behind. They won’t want to hear anything about picking the winner. Unless… (do you see where this is taking us?) Unless, it’s possible, in the same group, that your uncle could compete with your grandmother. This is where the divisions come into play: League A (professionals), League B (Semi-professionals), League C (Amateurs), League D (Juniors) and League E (Lanterns).",
    "WHY_2ND_PART": "- IN-CRE-DI-BLE!",
    "WHY_3RD_PART": "- You're the incredible one, by getting the beauty of the divisions.",

    "WHY_5TH_PART": "It's just like our Pick the Winner: win more points, ascend; lose points, descend. You compete with whoever is at your level, got it?",
    "WHY_6TH_PART": "We did what seemed impossible: apply to the Pick the Winner system, the same concept of categories of sports with a lot of diversity and players. It's a result of innovation.",
    "WHY_7TH_PART": "Better yet... If you aren't paying attention, you could be asking:",

    "AGE_RESTRICTION_ANSWER": "Nope! Of course not. BTW, when was the last time you spoke with your grandfather? Call and invite him to play.",
    "AGE_RESTRICTION_QUESTION": "Is there any age restriction for the participants?",
    "DIVISIONS_ANSWER": "To maximize the fun. Generally, throughout the contest, some players will stand out by winning more points and distancing themselves from the rest of the group. This interferes with the fun for the majority of the players. So, in the middle of the ranking, there is fierce competition among various participants so they can't stop playing. The champion of the other divisions of Pick the Winner is usually decided in the last match.  Take a better look here:",

    "HOWTO_SHARE_ANSWER": "There's nothing to it, two clicks and attitude: first you click on “Groups”, then on “Invite friends”. And then you will be thrilled.",
    "HOWTO_SHARE_QUESTION": "How can I invite my friends directly from the app?",
    "JOIN_GROUP_DEADLINE_ANSWER": "Ideally they should join before the first game starts, to feel the excitement of the opening game. And if one of your friends arrives late, no problem! Anyone can join at any time. We’ve created a function to prevent late arrivers from being penalized: minimum score for the late-comers. With this function in place, whoever joins the group in the middle of the competition will receive one point less than the lowest ranked player.",
    "JOIN_GROUP_DEADLINE_QUESTION": "How many friends can I invite to the group I create?",
    "MAKE_PREDICTION_DEADLINE_ANSWER": "You can do it nice and easy, pal. The deadline for picks closes five minutes before the game begins.",
    "MAKE_PREDICTION_DEADLINE_EXAMPLE": "For example: Lets imagine that there are 10 minutes left until the start of the seventh match of the tournament (Mexico vs. Poland) and you haven't made your picks for this game. Hurry up, my friend, there is still time to pick.  Just remember, five minutes before the referee blows the whistle to start the game, the picks for this game will be closed. Here's a tip: don't wait 'til the last minute. Just because you did that in school and it worked, it doesn't mean it always will.",
    "MAKE_PREDICTION_DEADLINE_QUESTION": "What is the deadline for making my picks?",
    "MAX_PLAYERS_ANSWER": "Not to worry, champ: the app was created in PHP, a language that can't support more than 9 quintillions. So that is the maximum number of participants that can join a group. But don't worry if you have a few extra friends, you can invite them too, because the exact number is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (~ ± 9 quintillions). Does that work for you? ;)",
    "MAX_PLAYERS_QUESTION": "What is the maximum number of participants in each group?",
    "RATING_ANSWER_1ST_PART": "Good idea. How about if we reach an agreement: you give us five stars and we consider that five is the new four. And we keep improving the app. ;)",
    "RATING_ANSWER_2ND_PART": "Come on, pal, make us happy and rate us here: iPhone (App Store) or Android (Play Store).",
    "RATING_QUESTION": "Do you know what I think? You guys created a great app and want the best evaluation. But I'm only going to give you 4 stars, because I don't want you guys to think the app is perfect, I want to see it improve.",
    "SEE_OTHER_PREDICTIONS_ANSWER": "Of course! but only after the game begins, wiseguy!",
    "SEE_OTHER_PREDICTIONS_QUESTIONS": "Can I see the choices of the other players in my group?",
    "SUGGESTIONS_ANSWER": "It's important to remember that if you are not doing well with your picks it's not our fault. Who told you to pick Tunisia?!  Talk to us",
    "SUGGESTIONS_ANSWER_LINK_TEXT": "here",
    "SUGGESTIONS_QUESTION": "I want to make a suggestion, a request, or a complaint.",
    "TIEBREAK_RULES_ANSWER_1ST_PART": "It works like this: let's imagine that you and your friend have the same number of points, each has 152 points. And the final match of the tounament is about to begin, Brazil v. Germany. Play! Whoever guesses the result takes the Pick the Winner trophy home (there isn't one!).",
    "TIEBREAK_RULES_ANSWER_2ND_PART": "Suddenly, the game is over. Result: Brazil wins 7-1. The fans go crazy and you're feeling great. When you check the ranking to see who won Pick the Winner, everyone is surprised! Both of you guessed exactly 7-1!! So who won?",
    "TIEBREAK_RULES_ANSWER_3RD_PART": "Simply, first the app is going to check who picked the winner of the game the most number of times. Another surprise, in the 64 matches of the tournament you both picked the winner 30 times. The second criteria comes into place: who guessed the exact score the most times. Result: another tie! Third criteria: who picked the score of the winning team the most times? Still tied. Fourth criteria: who guessed the score of the losing team the most times. Tie! Wow, now that is a miracle.",
    "TIEBREAK_RULES_ANSWER_4TH_PART": "Final tie break rule: who joined the pick the winner group first? You were both invited to participate in the group, but your friend was faster and registered first. The trophy goes to her and you will celebrate Brazil 7-1. Imagine how happy your group will be!",
    "TIEBREAK_RULES_QUESTION": "If there is a tie, how is the winner defined?",
    "TUNISIA_WIN_ANSWER": "What? Are you kidding? I think you are going to need a lot of luck in this Pick the Winner App, pal.",

    "INCREASE_FUN_WITH_POINTS_DESCRIPTION_3RD_PART": "And there is a special detail! At the end of the tournament, the last match, on 20th of August, awards double points! I hope your imagination is at full speed right now, so that you can see how in the last week of the tournament, with double points awarded for the final match, instead of 3 or 4 players with a chance to win, there will be a good chance for 7 or 8 players to compete for the Grand Prize of this contest.",

    "HOW_TO_KNOW_FAVORITE_DESCRIPTION_6TH_PART": "After this, we transform this percentage into points, based on a formula worthy of a Nobel in mathematices. BTW, you knew that a Nobel prize for mathematics doesn't exist, right? A Fields Medal is as close as it gets in this subject.",

However, three days before the match starts, we lock the score and it won't change again, independently of what may happen in the sportsbooks.

If the game continues after the extra time, you have to try to guess the result up to this stage, before the penalties. This way, if the winner is determined by penalties, whoever puts in a tie, wins.",

    "FIRST_TIP_TITLE": "Tip one",
    "FIRST_TIP_DESCRIPTION": "Remember: this is all about playing and having fun. Don't take it too seriously. If you don't pick the winning results, its OK. Being teased by the group is nothing personal, that's just the players inviting you to join the fun. If you're inspired, take life easy. Don't hold a grudge, it’s just a game!",
    "SECOND_TIP_TITLE": "Tip two",
    "SECOND_TIP_DESCRIPTION": "Create a group in WhatsApp (or some other Social Communication App) with the same people that are in your Pick the Winner group. In WhatsApp the fun and the festivities will have extra space to evolve.",
    "THIRD_TIP_TITLE": "Tip three",
    "THIRD_TIP_DESCRIPTION_1ST_PART": "This tip is essential. Offer a prize to the first player in each division. Winning on Semi-Pro or Amateurs division is a big deal. Even one little medal will make the group happy. If your group has three divisions, give a medal to the first three in each division. Buy some medals that look like gold, silver and bronze online, for a buck or two.",
    "THIRD_TIP_DESCRIPTION_2ND_PART": "You know why it is so much fun to play Secret Santa? Because everyone wins a prize. The pick the winner app isn't Secret Santa, but we found a way for more people to be winners: by creating the divisions.",
    "FOURTH_TIP_TITLE": "Tip four",
    "FOURTH_TIP_DESCRIPTION": "Your group's play will be super amazing if you hold a prize ceremony at the end of the tournament. Hold a real party with all of your friends and officially announce the winners. Any kind of get together goes. At the awards ceremony you are going to see the happiness on the podium and hear the applause. Imagine your grandfather on the podium, as the best of the amateurs (Group C). That's if he doesn't beat you to the top of the ranking! ",
    "FIFTH_TIP_TITLE": "Tip five",
    "FIFTH_TIP_DESCRIPTION_1ST_PART": "If you join a group only with your friends, consider creating another group, inviting family members and colleagues from work. The dynamic is much richer when we participate with different groups of friends.",
    "FIFTH_TIP_DESCRIPTION_2ND_PART": "You are being challenged with your friends to collect three unique elements: A soccer tournament, picking the winner and the friendship among people. “What do I have to do with this?” Simple Sherlock. With the tournament as a backdrop, the Pick the Winner app tightens friendships and increases the connection and fun interactions. In other words, creating more groups increases your chances of connecting with more people. Isn’t that super great?? Not to mention that you double your chances of being the winner!",
    "FIFTH_TIP_DESCRIPTION_3RD_PART": "For example: If you are a part of a group of very close friends, think of creating a larger group, allowing friends of friends to join. The app is intuitive and inviting, so you can participate in as many groups as you want.",
